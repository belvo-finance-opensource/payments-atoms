## ðŸš€ Getting started

### Installation

```bash
npm install belvo-payments-atoms
```

### Initialization

Add a default import from `belvo-payments-atoms` and call its `init` function with a callback so you're able to retrieve the selected payer institution. For example:

```js
import BelvoPaymentsAtoms from 'belvo-payments-atoms'

BelvoPaymentsAtoms.init({
  bankShortcuts: {
    // This callback is executed when the user selects a bank.
    // It returns the payer institution, containing its id, display_name and icon_logo.
    callback: (payerInstitution) => setPayerInstitutionId(payerInstitution.id),
  },
})
```

### Usage Example

Once initialized, simply add the desired web component wherever you wish in your web application.

```html
<belvo-payments-grid />
```

## ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¸ TypeScript

Belvo Payments Atoms has TypeScript support and provides a set of types that you can import into your project. We export them by default and you are able to import them as named imports like:

```typescript
import type { Callback, Country, Institution } from 'belvo-payments-atoms'
```
